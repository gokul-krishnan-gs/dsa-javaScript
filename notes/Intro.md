## ✨ Definition  
A **Data Structure** is a specific way of **organizing, storing, and accessing data** efficiently so that it can be used effectively in programs.  

---

## 🔑 Key Points  
- 📦 **Organizing** → How data is arranged (linear, hierarchical, etc.)  
- 💾 **Storing** → How data is kept in memory (arrays, linked lists, etc.)  
- ⚡ **Accessing** → How quickly we can retrieve or update data

- # 📐 Algorithm

## ✨ Definition  
An **algorithm** is a **set of step-by-step instructions** that tells a computer how to perform a task or solve a problem.  
It's a **step-by-step solution** to solve a problem.

---

## Time Complexity
 How long an algorithm will take to run

 ## Space Complexity
 How much memory an algorithm will need as the amount of data it handles grows

## constatn gives : O(1)
## single for loop is : O(n)
## nested loop is : O(n^2)
## divide and conquer gives O(logn)
